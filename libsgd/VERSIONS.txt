***** v0.03 *****

* Fixed CreateCubeMesh cubes scaled by 2 for some reason.

* Added sgd_SetMeshCastsShadoqw and sgd_SetLightCastsShadow.

* Begin work on shadowmapping!

* Added sgd_DebugMemory() for debug LibSGD builds only right now.

* Added sgd_ClearScene() and sgd_DestroyEntity(). Note ClearScene() just destroys everything, more subtle memory
management coming but this is enough to write a game with at least.

* Added sgd_Startup() and sgd_Shutdown() (not required in Blitz3D).

* Added suspend-on-minimize behaviour, and EVENT_MASK_SUSPENDED and EVENT_MASK_RESUMED events.

* Added sgd_WindowHasFocus(), and EVENT_MASK_LOST_FOCUS and EVENT_MASK_GOT_FOCUS events.

* Added sgd_CopyEntity(), sgd_FPS().
