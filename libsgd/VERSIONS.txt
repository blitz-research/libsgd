***** V0.05 *****

* Add mesh building commands, see makesphere.bb, not really enough to pull apart existing meshes.

* Added support for ~ at start of file paths.

* Moved fetch cache to ~/.sgd/cache dir

* Tidied up logging a bit, log file is now written to ~/.sgd/log.txt and echoed to stdout by default.

* Added audio functions.


***** V0.04.1 *****

* Tidied up external CMakeLists.txt

* Merged Dawn with upstream version.

* Fixed ImGui backend always passing mouse/keyboard events to SGD app.


***** V0.04 *****

* Added an ImGui backend to sgd_dynamic! See tests/libsgd_tests_imgui.cpp for example usage. This wont run 'as is', you'll need to add sgd_dynamic.dll to the exe dir.

* Added SetMouseCursorMode to show, hide, disable or capture the mouse cursor.

* Added 2 new texture formats. WARNING! This will likely affect all blitz3d env map loaders that use texture format 2, change to 4!

* Added a bunch of 2D overlay functions, more to come. See overlay.bb


***** V0.03.1b *****

* Renamed sgd_Startup()/sgd_Shutdown() to sgd_Init()/sgd_Terminate() to keep MS Windows Defender happy.


***** V0.03.1 *****

* Entity matrices now use 64 bit double precision floats on 64 bit targets, for initial WIP 'huge world' support.

* Fixed a (the?) DestroyEntity bug.

* Added ClearScene to blitz3d.


***** v0.03 *****

* Fixed lots of mesh primitive issues, including all box meshes scaled by 2 for some reason.

* Added sgd_SetMeshCastsShadoqw and sgd_SetLightCastsShadow, both off by default for now.

* Begin work on shadowmapping!

* Added sgd_ClearScene() and sgd_DestroyEntity(). Note ClearScene() just destroys everything, more subtle memory management coming but this is enough to write a game with at least.

* Added sgd_Startup() and sgd_Shutdown() (not required in Blitz3D).

* Added suspend-on-minimize behaviour, and EVENT_MASK_SUSPENDED and EVENT_MASK_RESUMED events.

* Added sgd_WindowHasFocus(), and EVENT_MASK_LOST_FOCUS and EVENT_MASK_GOT_FOCUS events.

* Added sgd_CopyEntity(), sgd_FPS().
