LibSGD is a simple game development library that provides a high level, easy to use 'scene graph' style API for writing games and apps that require modern, realtime 3d graphics, as well as (eventually) audio and networking capabilities.

The library is coded in C++, but the primary public API is pure 'C', making it highly compatible with a wide range of platforms and languages.

LibSGD is licensed under the Zlib/PNG license.
